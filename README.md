# 2048-NEAT
This project uses an existing game of 2048 from: https://github.com/kiteco/python-youtube-code/tree/master/build-2048-in-python.
First, we train the NEAT algorithm to play the game. Then we perform a validation run to test the trained network.
For more information about NEAT, see the NEAT documentation: https://neat-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html
